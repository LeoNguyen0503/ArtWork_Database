Compile on Mac/Linux with:

javac -cp ojdbc7.jar: Main.java OracleGUI.java 

Compile on Windows with:

javac -cp ojdbc7.jar .\Main.java OracleGUI.java

Run on Mac/Linux with:

java -cp ojdbc7.jar: Main OracleGUI

Run on Windows with:

java -cp ".;ojdbc7.jar" Main OracleGUI   

I recommend to put the ojdbc7.jar file in the same directory with the GUI file and the Main file.

This application is to practice on using Oracle SQL, how to create and insert into table. 

Users can add record, delete record and/or view/update record using the application.

The application is not 100% finished yet.
